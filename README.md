# hello-world
My first repository


Hey guys, my name is Gary. I am 25 years old, almost 26. I don't know much about coding, but I am happy and willing to learn! I have struggled in the past with retaining
information and will give it my all this time around! I enjoy playing video games as a hobby, I prefer FPS/battle royales and rocket league. I can type pretty quick all 
thanks to runescape, one of childhood games. I am thrilled to get to know everyone and learn to code. 

Thanks for reading.
